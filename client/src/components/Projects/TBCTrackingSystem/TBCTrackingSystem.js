        <p>
          <strong>TBC Tracking System</strong> is an internal tool designed to monitor customer orders from placement to shipment. This system provides real-time visibility into the fulfillment pipeline and is aimed at improving transparency and logistics efficiency within the warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to integrate this system into a broader dealer-facing dashboard, where authorized users can log in and track the status of their orders. This will be one of several tools planned for a complete Dealer Portal currently in development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My Role:</strong> I am responsible for designing and implementing the entire tracking system, including the backend architecture, database integration, and frontend interfaces for both internal use and future dealer-facing access.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">Demo not available â€“ project still in development.</p>
